# A-Simple-Calculator

This is a simple Calculator with two numbers with no styling. I will add styles later. I want to practice JavaScript.

I started learning JavaScript last week but I got sick few days ago. I missed coding for days. 

I created this project to revise what I learned to get back on my development journey.
