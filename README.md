# A-Simple-Calculator

<h2><a href="https://h4sitha.github.io/A-Simple-Calculator/">Live demo.</a></h2>

This is a simple Calculator with two numbers with no styling. Okay a little styling. I want to practice JavaScript.

I started learning JavaScript last week but I got sick few days ago. I missed coding for days. 

I created this project to revise what I learned to get back on my development journey.
